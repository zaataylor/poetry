"Full-Gutted"

Whatever is the
    substance I am feeling,
Whatever is the
    influence of those things which I am under,
Whatever
    outrages me...
Still the word turns,
New breaths are breathed into the collective consciousness, and
A subtle hymn, bare and full-gutted, arises from my belly,
    that bubbling cauldron of miscellaneous foodstuffs and
    home of intricate mysteries:

    "Think rather,-â€” call to thought, if now you grieve a little, 
     The days when we had rest, O soul, for they were long."
