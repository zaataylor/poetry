# Meat Computers

Meat Computers:

Not exactly Von Neumann.

Some are AMD but above all,

Sensations and correlations and associations are

the primary, non-binary data,

(the means)...while

neuron bundles and structures comprise our strictures...

(the ends).

When meet two meat computers,
A benchmarking battle ensues.

Sometimes they use the same ISA,
Other times not.
