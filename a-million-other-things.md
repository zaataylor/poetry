"A Million Other Things"


I want to set my mind free to roam an ethereal realm
    that materializes as fast as I can imagine it.
I want to find a sweet place with the warm succor of a hearth, and set it in my belly
    to keep it safe.
My heart, fixed on a poetic image of beauty like no other, wishes to find harmony in my gaze.
My ears will tingle and resonate with the sound of it,
my skin will flush,
and my heart will flutter
    at the mere sight of it.
I cannot name it, but I can trace its delicate contours,
    outlining the imprint it leaves on my life and the lives of others.
Whispering to me like a westerly wind, it speaks to me in a language too ancient to decipher,
and yet I know exactly what it commands me to do:
    go here,
    feel this,
    say that
    and a million other things.
And so I say this and a million other things.
